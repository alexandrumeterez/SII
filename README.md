# SII - Sisteme integrate inteligente

I had this course in my 4th year during undergraduate. It's sort of an introduction to robotics.
I made this repo to store most of the stuff I learned and coded for this course. Had a lot of fun.
What you can find here:

- Kalman Filter
- Extended Kalman Filter
- EKF for a pendulum swing with bias estimation
